# Machine Learning and Statistics 2021 Assessment

## Summary of Assignment
This repository contains my machine learning and statistics assessment 2021. It looks at linear regression using Python on the pwerproduction dataset.  My notebook contains explanation for each of the lines of input and output code.

I commenced work on this assignment on 27th September 2021 and completed work for the deadline of 19th December 2021.

## Liabries used in this Assignment
I impoted: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn

* Matplolib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive enviroments across platforms.

* Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

* NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

* Pandas is an open source, BDS-licenced libary providing high-oerfimance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

* Scikit-Learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.(1)

## Running the Jupyter Notebook 2
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows): jupyter notebook This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.

When started, the Jupyter Notebook App can access only files within its start-up folder (including any sub-folder). No configuration is necessary if you place your notebooks in your home folder or subfolders. Otherwise, you need to choose a Jupyter Notebook App start-up folder which will contain all the notebooks.

Download the notebook you want to execute and put it in your notebook folder (or a sub-folder of it).

Then follow these steps:

Launch the Jupyter Notebook App (see previous section). In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab. Click on the menu Help -> User Interface Tour for an overview of the Jupyter Notebook App user interface. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All. To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu Kernel -> Restart. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etcâ€¦).
